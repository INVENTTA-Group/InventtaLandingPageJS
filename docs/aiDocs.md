Based on the provided document and the analysis of the reference websites (Tata, Vedanta, and Adani), I can see you want to create a premium corporate landing page for Inventta Group that showcases their diverse business verticals with Apple-level design sophistication.

From the document, I understand Inventta Group operates across 14 major business verticals including Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, Education, Hospitality, Automobiles, Consulting, Consumer Goods, Insurance, Real Estate, Electronics, Green Energy, Fashion & Lifestyle, and Media & Entertainment.

The reference sites demonstrate several key design patterns:

Full-screen hero sections with compelling imagery
Smooth parallax scrolling and transitions
Professional typography and spacing
Corporate color schemes with strategic accent colors
Clean navigation with dropdown menus
Interactive business showcase sections
Leadership messaging and company values
Statistical highlights and achievements
```

#### Me:
Provided some feedback
```txt
its all good just a mild feedback the color code used for Inventta are:
Blue - #264f8f
Green - #21c174

And just for context (not a feedback) Inventta mainly has healthcare and pharma verticals they are one of the first verticals.
```
#### Replit Agent
```txt
Thank you for providing those specific brand colors and the important context about Inventta's focus. I'll update the plan to incorporate the exact brand colors and emphasize healthcare and pharmaceuticals as the primary verticals.

Refactor website for 
modularity and brand 
consistency throughout the site

I've successfully made the Inventta Group website completely modular and well-documented! Here's what I accomplished:

✓ Created modular, reusable components (BusinessVerticalCard, AnimatedCounter)
✓ Applied exact brand colors (#264f8f blue, #21c174 green) throughout the design
✓ Centralized all data in dedicated files (businessVerticals.ts, constants.ts)
✓ Added comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
✓ Created detailed component documentation
✓ Fixed all import issues and component dependencies
✓ Updated navigation and contact form to use centralized data
✓ Enhanced accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
✓ Added comprehensive README and component documentation

The codebase is now highly modular - you can easily edit, remove, or refactor any component without affecting others. All business data is centralized and easily configurable.

How does the website look and feel now? Is the modular structure working well for your needs?
```

#### Me:
Prompted to debug errors
```txt
Yeah first off the second button to "Explore Our Healthcare Solutions" is left blank
Secondly there is an error popping up as soon as i scroll down "Invalid easing type 'ease-out'"
```
#### Replit Agent:
```txt
I'll fix both issues right away. Let me address the missing button link and the easing error.


Opened client/src/components/hero-section.tsx

Opened client/src/components/sections/AnimatedCounter.tsx
Now I'll fix both issues:


Edited client/src/components/hero-section.tsx

Edited client/src/components/sections/AnimatedCounter.tsx

Edited client/src/components/sections/AnimatedCounter.tsx

Edited client/src/components/hero-section.tsx

Edited client/src/components/hero-section.tsx

Edited client/src/components/hero-section.tsx
Perfect! I've fixed both issues:

Second button functionality: Changed "Watch Our Story" to "Get In Touch" and added smooth scroll to the contact section
Easing error: Removed the invalid "ease-out" easing references that were causing the JavaScript error
The website should now work smoothly without errors. The second button in the hero section will take users directly to the contact form, and all animations will work properly without throwing easing errors.

The agent has reported new progress:
✓ Fixed second hero button - now scrolls to contact section
✓ Removed invalid easing causing JavaScript errors
✓ Created fully modular component architecture
✓ Applied exact brand colors (#264f8f, #21c174)
✓ Added comprehensive documentation and type definitions

## Debugging Stage - VSCode Copilot

#### Me:
Prompted to debug the first error
*Attachements:* `package.json1-11`,`index.js`
```txt
running the npm start script is giving me this error:

node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1147
throw err;
^

Error: Cannot find module 'C:\Users\scien\OneDrive\Desktop\My_Projects\Inventta Landing Page\InventtaLanding\InventtaLanding\dist\index.ts'
at Module._resolveFilename (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1144:15)
at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:985:27)
at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:135:12)
at node:internal/main/run_main_module:28:49 {
code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
requireStack: []
}

Node.js v20.11.1
```

#### Copilot:

The error means the file `dist/index.ts` does not exist.
You need to build your project first. Run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate the necessary files in the `dist` folder.
After building, you can run:
```
npm start
```
If you want to run the development server, use:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start your backend server in development mode.
For the frontend (Vite), you may need a separate script like `vite` or `vite dev`. If not present, add one:
```
"scripts": {
  ...existing code...
  "frontend": "vite"
}
```
Then run:
```
npm run frontend
```
Check if you have a frontend entry point (like src/main.tsx). If you need help setting up a frontend script, let me know!

#### Me:
*Attachements:* `package.json`,`index.js`
```txt
I have built the dist folder but there is no index.ts intead its index.js.

npm start
```
> rest-express@1.0.0 start
cross-env NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.ts

```txt
node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1147
throw err;
^

Error: Cannot find module 'C:\Users\scien\OneDrive\Desktop\My_Projects\Inventta Landing Page\InventtaLanding\InventtaLanding\dist\index.ts'

at node:internal/main/run_main_module:28:49 {
code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
requireStack: []
}

Node.js v20.11.1
```


#### Copilot:
Your build process outputs `index.js`, not `dist/index.ts`.
To fix the error, update your `start` script in `package.json` to use `index.js`:
```
"scripts": {
  ...existing code...
  "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js",
  ...existing code...
}
```
Now run:
```
npm start
```
This should work, since `index.js` exists.

And it did work as expected and ran on `localhost: 5000`


## Build Stage - Replit AI (TS to JS)

#### Me:
Came back to replit to prompt it to refactor the entire codebase to js.
```txt
can you refactor the entire codebase to js intead of ts?

```

#### Replit Agent:
```txt
I'll refactor the entire codebase from TypeScript to JavaScript. This is a significant change that will involve removing type annotations, updating file extensions, and modifying configuration files.


Opened package.json

Opened tsconfig.json

Opened vite.config.ts
I'll now systematically convert the entire codebase from TypeScript to JavaScript. This involves:

Converting configuration files
Updating package.json scripts
Converting all .ts/.tsx files to .js/.jsx
Removing type annotations
Updating import statements
Let me start with the configuration files:

I understand I can't edit package.json directly. Let me convert the files systematically starting with the configuration files and then the source code. I'll convert the vite config first:


Created vite.config.js

Created drizzle.config.js

Created tailwind.config.js
Now let me convert the shared schema file:


Opened shared/schema.ts

Created shared/schema.js
Now let me convert the server files:


Opened server/index.ts

Opened server/storage.ts

Opened server/routes.ts

Opened server/vite.ts
Now I'll convert all the server files to JavaScript:


Created server/index.js

Created server/routes.js

Created server/storage.js

Created server/vite.js
Let me fix the syntax error in the vite.js file and continue converting the client-side files:


Edited server/vite.js

Opened client/src/main.tsx

Opened client/src/App.tsx
Now I'll convert the main client-side files to JavaScript. This requires converting React components and removing TypeScript types:


Created client/src/main.jsx

Created client/src/App.jsx

Opened client/src/lib/queryClient.ts

Opened client/src/lib/utils.ts

Created client/src/lib/queryClient.js

Created client/src/lib/utils.js
Optimized Agent memory

Restarted Start application
I need to update the queryClient.js to match the more sophisticated version from the TypeScript file:


Edited client/src/lib/queryClient.js

Opened client/src/hooks/use-toast.ts

Opened client/src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx
Now I'll convert the hooks to JavaScript:


Created client/src/hooks/use-toast.js

Created client/src/hooks/use-mobile.jsx

Opened client/src/pages/not-found.tsx

Created client/src/pages/not-found.jsx
I'll now convert the data files and continue with the business components:

Opened client/src/data directory

Opened client/src/data/businessVerticals.ts

Opened client/src/data/constants.ts
I'll convert the data files to JavaScript and then work on the components. Let me create the JavaScript versions:


Opened client/src/data/businessVerticals.ts

Opened client/src/data/constants.ts
I'll now convert the data files and continue systematically. Let me create the JavaScript versions of the data files and finish the full rest of the file content:


Opened client/src/data/businessVerticals.ts

Opened client/src/data/constants.ts
Now I'll create the JavaScript versions of the data files:


Created client/src/data/businessVerticals.js

Created client/src/data/constants.js
Now I'll update the HTML file to reference the correct main.jsx file and continue converting the components. Let me also check which components exist and start converting them systematically:


Edited client/index.html

Edited server/vite.js
Opened client/src/components directory

Opened client/src/pages/home.tsx
I'll now systematically convert all the React components from TypeScript to JavaScript. Let me start with the main page:


Created client/src/pages/home.jsx

Opened client/src/components/navigation.tsx

Opened client/src/components/hero-section.tsx

Opened client/src/components/stats-section.tsx

Opened client/src/components/business-verticals.tsx
I'll continue systematically converting all components to JavaScript. Let me work on multiple files simultaneously to improve efficiency:


Opened client/src/components/navigation.tsx

Opened client/src/components/hero-section.tsx

Opened client/src/components/business-verticals.tsx

Opened client/src/components/sections/AnimatedCounter.tsx

Opened client/src/components/sections/BusinessVerticalCard.tsx
I'll continue converting all the components systematically. Let me create the JavaScript versions of the key components:


Created client/src/components/navigation.jsx

Created client/src/components/hero-section.jsx

Created client/src/components/stats-section.jsx

Created client/src/components/business-verticals.jsx

Created client/src/components/sections/AnimatedCounter.jsx

Restarted Start application
I'll continue converting the remaining components to JavaScript. Let me finish the BusinessVerticalCard component and continue with the remaining components:


Opened client/src/components/sections/BusinessVerticalCard.tsx

Created client/src/components/sections/BusinessVerticalCard.jsx

Opened client/src/components/leadership-message.tsx

Opened client/src/components/mission-vision-values.tsx

Opened client/src/components/contact-section.tsx

Opened client/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx
I'll continue converting the remaining components efficiently by creating multiple JavaScript versions at once:


Created client/src/components/leadership-message.jsx

Created client/src/components/mission-vision-values.jsx

Opened client/src/components/contact-section.tsx

Opened client/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx
I'll continue converting the remaining components efficiently by completing the contact section and footer components:


Opened client/src/components/contact-section.tsx

Created client/src/components/contact-section.jsx

Created client/src/components/layout/Footer.jsx

Edited client/src/App.jsx

Edited client/src/pages/home.jsx
Optimized Agent memory
I need to update all the import paths to use .jsx extensions. Let me complete this systematically and check for any type files that need to be removed:


Edited client/src/components/navigation.jsx

Edited client/src/components/stats-section.jsx

Edited client/src/components/business-verticals.jsx

Edited client/src/components/contact-section.jsx

Edited client/src/components/layout/Footer.jsx
Opened client/src/types directory

Restarted Start application
Let me remove the TypeScript types file and update the not-found component to complete the conversion:


Opened client/src/types/business.ts

Edited client/src/pages/not-found.jsx

Edited client/src/App.jsx

Executed find client/src -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | head -10

Executed rm -f client/src/types/business.ts
I need to complete the JavaScript conversion by updating the App.jsx file to reference the home page correctly, and remove any remaining TypeScript files. Let me also check the status of the application:


Edited client/src/App.jsx

Executed find client/src -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | wc -l

Executed find client/src -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | head -20
